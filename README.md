# Computer-Vision-Project
* We have a photograph of some coins. We created a 'coin value' calculator which can look at the image and estimate 
  the value of the coins in the image. We ignored one 50 paise coin as it was not circular. 
* Our calculator also provide the estimated total value of the coins present in the image. 
* We solved this problem by using openCV (open Source Computer Vision Library) in Python.
